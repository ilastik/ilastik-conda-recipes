about:
  summary: |
    A pseudo-package that symlinks your system Gurobi libraries into the conda environment.
    This package does NOT install Gurobi.  You must install Gurobi externally, 
    and set the GUROBI_ROOT_DIR environment variable before installing this package.
    (This package does its work at install time, not build time.)
    **DON'T FORGET TO ACTIVATE YOUR GUROBI LICENSE!**
